    I learned how to use tinkercad. 
    I'm working on making the goldberg machine in tinkercad.
    A goldberg machine is a machine that uses chain reactions.
    You should always have protective goggles, masks, and other protective gear in the workshop.
    You should also never bring food in the workshop.
    I had fun making a washing machine in tinkercad.
